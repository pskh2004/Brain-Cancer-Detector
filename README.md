Introduction
This project leverages deep learning techniques to assist in the early detection of brain tumors using MRI images. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of brain MRI images labeled as either ‘tumor’ or ‘normal’. The dataset is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hamzahabib47/brain-cancer-detection-mri-images

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
You can install the required libraries using:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/pskh2004/Brain-Cancer-Detector.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd Brain-Cancer-Detector

Run the preprocessing script to prepare the dataset:
python preprocess.py

Train the model:
python train.py

Evaluate the model:
python evaluate.py

Use the model to make predictions on new MRI images:
python predict.py --image_path path_to_image

Model Architecture
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification. The architecture includes:

Convolutional layers for feature extraction
Max-pooling layers for down-sampling
Fully connected layers for classification
Training
The model is trained on the MRI dataset using the following steps:

Data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training data.
Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.
Compiling the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
Training the model with early stopping and learning rate reduction techniques.
Evaluation
The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model’s performance.

Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the validation set. The confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics indicate that the model performs well in distinguishing between tumor and normal MRI images.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in medical imaging and tumor detection. The trained model can assist radiologists in diagnosing brain tumors more efficiently.

Future Work
Improve the model by using more advanced architectures like ResNet or Inception.
Incorporate more diverse datasets to enhance the model’s generalizability.
Explore the use of transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models.
