Project Title: Brain MRI Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning
Introduction
This project aims to develop a deep learning model to classify brain MRI images as either having a tumor or being normal. The model will be trained on a dataset of brain MRI images and will be capable of accurately identifying tumors in new MRI scans.

Objectives
To preprocess and analyze MRI datasets.
To build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for tumor detection.
To evaluate the model’s performance using various metrics.
To deploy the model for real-time tumor detection.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of brain MRI images, which are labeled as either ‘tumor’ or ‘normal’. The dataset is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hamzahabib47/brain-cancer-detection-mri-images

Methodology
Data Preprocessing:
Load and explore the dataset.
Perform data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training data.
Normalize the images to ensure uniformity.
Model Building:
Design a CNN architecture suitable for image classification.
Compile the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
Training:
Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
Train the model on the training set and validate it on the validation set.
Use techniques like early stopping and learning rate reduction to optimize training.
Evaluation:
Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Generate a confusion matrix to visualize the model’s performance.
Deployment:
Save the trained model.
Develop a user interface for uploading new MRI images and displaying the prediction results.
Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the validation set.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in medical imaging and tumor detection. The trained model can assist radiologists in diagnosing brain tumors more efficiently.
